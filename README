This project is growing to be a Java API for the PBWorks REST API, with file backup as a demo application.

either build and run manually (still on JDK 8) using

mvn clean package
mvn exec:exec -Dexec.executable="java" -Dexec.args="-DPBWORKS_API_READ_KEY=... -classpath %classpath de.sophienallee.backup.Backup"

or use dockerized build

docker build -t pbworks-bak:latest .
docker run -e PBWORKS_API_READ_KEY=... -v my-export-dir:/export pbworks-bak:latest
